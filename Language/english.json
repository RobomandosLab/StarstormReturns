Regardless of the validity of their claims, a survivor's a survivor. As I'm writing this, we're carrying him back. He's certainly not making it easy on us, though, considering the sheer heft of his gear- he's lugging some unorthodox modifications to a standard Commando armor rig.

He’s out cold right now, and from what we can tell looking through his helmet he's well-battered. His left arm seems especially stiff- his hand's clamped shut around the handle of his vibroblade. Some of us tried to get a good look at it just now, but it's almost like his fist is fused to the damn thing.
