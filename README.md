**Starstorm Returns** is a **work-in-progress** mod for Risk of Rain Returns that re-imagines the original Risk of Rain mod "Starstorm". It currently features **four** survivors, **two** stages, **two** monsters, and over **20** new items to help reshape your runs. 

![New_Environments_Header](https://github.com/WinslowRoR/testing_grounds1/blob/main/PromoFiles/SSR_Environments.gif?raw=true)

**New Environments**
* Explore new and improved stages returning from Starstorm. Brave the **Whistling Basin**, a crumbling and desolate visage of what once was, or journey into the **Torrid Outlands**, a barren and scorching dust bowl, to help spice up your runs!

![New_Items_Header](https://github.com/WinslowRoR/SSR-PromoStuff/blob/main/README%20Stuff/SSR_Items.gif?raw=true)

**New Items**
* Make use of the refined and enhanced items, old and new, to help you brave this dangerous planet. Watch your back with the **Guarding Amulet** whilst utilizing the electric capabilities of the **Man-o'-War**, with your new beastly friend hatched from the **Juddering Egg**- and more!

![New_Enemies_Header](https://github.com/WinslowRoR/SSR-PromoStuff/blob/main/README%20Stuff/SSR_Enemies.gif?raw=true)

**New Enemies**
* Brand new monsters arise to face you as you tear through Petrichor V. Tango with the **Clay Admonitor**, a beefy pot brawler, and watch your step for **Exploders** that- well, explode- and more as you traverse through your runs!

**New Survivors**

Descend to Petrichor V with reworked, polished and incredibly unique characters. 

* **Executioner**: Armed to the teeth with an ion-powered arsenal, the Executioner makes quick work of the hordes of monsters that stand in his way.

* **MULE**:  The MULE is adequately equipped and ready for duty, packing a rueful piston punch (despite its weathered appearance).

* **Technician**: With his complex gadgets and steel wrench in tow, the Technician is the man for the industrial job. 

* **???**: Old and eroded, twisted and deceptive- familiar faces all the same.
